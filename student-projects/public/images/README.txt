Place your Figma prototype background image here and name it "background.jpg" (or update the CSS URL accordingly).

For the home page portal cards you can either:
- drop actual images here named `student-portal.jpg` and `admin-portal.jpg`, or
- continue using the placeholder service URLs that are currently hard‑coded in `Home.js`.

If you add real images, update the `src` attributes in `Home.js` accordingly.
